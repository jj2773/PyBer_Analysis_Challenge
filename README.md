# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge
##Overview of the analysis:
A python based ride-sharing app was created by a company named PyBer.  The CEO of PyBer would like the ride-sharing data analyzed from January to early May of 2019 to develop strategies around city types (urban, suburban, and rural).

##Results:
As seen in the summary data figure the total rides over the four month period were small.  In fact, rural areas only accounted for 125 rides which is roughly two rides per driver.  Similarly urban areas only had 1,625 rides for 2,405 drivers which is less than one ride per driver.  Lastly, suburban areas fell in between with just over 1 ride per driver.  

More alarming is the average fare per driver shown in the figure.  It was largest in the rural areas at $55.49 and smallest for urban areas at $16.57.  The suburban fares per driver falling in between at $39.50.  Rural areas were also the highest average fare per ride at $34.62 while urban areas was the lowest at $24.53.

Looking at the time trending total fares it appears that the only growth occuring in this time period was for urban cities.

##Summary:
This data indicates that in the past four months our drivers are making little money using our service.  They are likley to be making most of their fares from other competitor companies.  A benchmarking study for other ride share companies should be performed to keep the number of drivers while we are trying to get more customers to use our app for rides.  With driver's being independent contractors, PyBar's revenue is only tied to a percentage of the fare, so it is recommended to invest more in urban marketing and advertising which already shows growth in this period of time.  During this benchmarking it should be studied if the percentage of PyBar's fare could be increased for the suburban and rural areas.
